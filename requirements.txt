DP-UNet achieved state-of-the-art performance among the compared methods across all benchmarks. On ISPRS Potsdam (86.71% mIoU), it excelled in boundary-sensitive categories like “Lowveg” and “Building”, yielding clearer contours (Fig. 4). On ISPRS Vaihingen (83.84% mIoU), it showed strong performance on small objects like “Cars” (Fig. 5), benefiting from the dedicated local-detail enhancement path (including PMC). On LoveDA (53.21% mIoU), it improved structured categories like “Building” and “Road” (Fig. 6), highlighting effective global–local collaboration.
