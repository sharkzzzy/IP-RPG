The structure of the DVSS is shown in Fig. 1(c). The input feature 
X ∈ ℝ^(B×H×W×C) is first normalized and processed by the SS2D module 
to produce a shared foundational feature F_s. This feature serves 
both paths: the global path retains F_s directly, while the local 
detail path processes it as follows.


where B is a tensor of all ones, and ⊙ represents element-wise 
multiplication. These modulated weights W_eff are applied to convolve 
the feature (ECA(F_s) + F_s), producing the local path output F_l.


Finally, the outputs of both paths are fused via the APFG module. 
As shown in Fig. 2(b), APFG applies channel-wise attention to each 
path independently: it performs global average pooling, followed 
by a bottleneck structure (reduction and expansion via linear layers) 
with sigmoid activation to generate attention weights. Each path's 
feature is recalibrated by its own attention weights, and the results 
are summed: Y = X + DropPath(APFG(F_g) + APFG(F_l)).
