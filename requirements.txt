The proposed DP-UNet is an improved architecture over CM-UNet, 
designed to enhance segmentation accuracy and optimize computational 
efficiency through structural innovations. It achieves these goals 
by replacing the original MSAA with the MSK module to eliminate 
redundant computations and by introducing the DVSS block in place 
of the single-path CSMamba block, thereby decoupling global context 
modeling from local detail refinement. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), 
the network consists of three main components: the ResNet-18-based 
encoders for extracting multi-level features, the MSK modules for 
multi-scale feature fusion, and the decoders with DVSS block that 
utilize a dual-path approach for better semantic understanding.

Specifically, given input I ∈ ℝ^(B×H×W×3), the encoder produces 
{F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4}, and MSK fuses F_1, F_2, F_3 (see Section II-B). 
Each DVSS block processes its input X through: (1) shared feature 
extraction F_s = SS2D(LN(X)); (2) global path F_g = F_s; (3) local 
path F_l = Conv(ECA(F_s)+F_s; W_eff), where W_eff from Eq.(1) is 
applied to ECA-recalibrated features; (4) fusion Y = X + DropPath(APFG(F_g, F_l)). 
The model is trained with L = L_main + Σλ_i·L_aux^i (cross-entropy, 
λ_i = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2).
