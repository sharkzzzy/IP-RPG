This study successfully transitions from "attention stacking" to 
fundamental "architecture rethinking." By proposing a dual-path 
decoupled architecture that explicitly separates global and local 
processing, we effectively overcome the computational redundancy 
and performance bottlenecks of the baseline model. This strategic 
decoupling, coupled with a streamlined attention mechanism, not 
only significantly enhances inference efficiency but also achieves 
superior segmentation accuracy on multiple remote sensing benchmarks, 
delivering a more powerful and practical solution for remote sensing 
image segmentation.

While effective, the proposed approach has limitations. The current 
experiments focus on optical remote sensing images with a limited 
number of land-cover categories (5-7 classes); the performance on 
multi-spectral or SAR imagery with more complex class distributions 
remains to be validated. Future work will extend the evaluation to 
a broader range of sensor types and application scenarios.
