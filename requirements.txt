1. Introduction 第二段 ✅ 安全
原文：

"To address these challenges, recent research combines lightweight state-space models with CNN-based architectures. Traditional U-Net [1] architectures, whether based on CNNs [2] or Transformers [3], struggle with large-scale scenes and suffer from high computational complexity. Combining state-space models with CNNs leverages both efficiency and the rich features from pretrained CNN models. A notable advancement is CM-UNet [4], which combines a CNN-based encoder with a Mamba-based [5] decoder, employing a CSMamba block with channel-spatial attention gating and a Multi-Scale Attention Aggregation (MSAA) module for feature fusion."

2. Introduction 第三段（CM-UNet问题描述）⚠️ 谨慎
原文：

"Despite its strong performance across various tasks, CM-UNet still exhibits certain limitations. First, its coupled architecture presents a bottleneck. The CSMamba module processes both global context modeling and local detail refinement within a single sequential pathway. We argue that these are two fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. Forcing them to share parameters and computational flow limits the model's capacity to excel at either task optimally. Second, it suffers from attention redundancy. The MSAA module at the feature fusion stage already incorporates both channel and spatial attention. The subsequent reapplication of the same channel and spatial attention mechanisms within the SS2D module. Although this multi-level homogeneous attention design enhances feature focusing to some extent, it inevitably increases model complexity and computational overhead."

3. Conclusion 第一段 ✅ 安全
原文：

"This study successfully transitions from "attention stacking" to fundamental "architecture rethinking." By proposing a dual-path decoupled architecture that explicitly separates global and local processing, we effectively overcome the computational redundancy and performance bottlenecks of the baseline model. This strategic decoupling, coupled with a streamlined attention mechanism, not only significantly enhances inference efficiency but also achieves superior segmentation accuracy on multiple remote sensing benchmarks, delivering a more powerful and practical solution for remote sensing image segmentation."
