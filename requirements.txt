while Blocks 3, 2, 1 progressively fuse upsampled features with skip features F₃', F₂', F₁' via concatenation, 1×1 projection, and DVSS processing. Each DVSS decouples global and local processing—the local path applies ECA for channel recalibration followed by PMC-modulated convolution (

 ), then both paths are fused by APFG. Auxiliary heads at Blocks 2–4 provide deep supervision.
