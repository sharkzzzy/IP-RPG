The PMC module is inspired by Learnable Deformable Convolution (LDC) 
[8], but operates in the parameter domain rather than the spatial 
domain. This design choice is motivated by a key observation: 
standard convolutions exhibit a center-dominance tendency, where 
center weights consistently receive larger magnitudes after training. 
This is an architectural bias that data-driven optimization reinforces 
rather than corrects. By shifting the deformation from the spatial 
to the parameter domain, PMC eliminates the complex coordinate offset 
and interpolation computations required in traditional LDC, while 
providing an explicit prior to counteract center-dominance. 

The core mechanism works as follows: a dynamic mask, correlated 
with the convolutional kernel weights, adaptively modulates the 
convolution weights and suppresses the intensity at the kernel's 
center. This suppression compels the network to gather information 
from neighboring positions, enhancing sensitivity to edges and fine 
textures—precisely the local details this path aims to capture.
