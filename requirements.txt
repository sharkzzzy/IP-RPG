“The decoder consists of four stages, where each stage employs a DVSS block that decouples global and local processing. In the local branch, ECA is applied for channel recalibration, followed by a convolution with PMC-modulated weights (W_{\mathrm{eff}}). The resulting global/local features ((F_g, F_l)) are then fused by APFG. We now detail this design.”


where $\mathrm{Enc}(\cdot)$ denotes the encoder, $\mathrm{Proj}(\cdot)$ is a point-wise projection for channel reduction, and $\mathrm{Up}(\cdot)$ denotes bilinear upsampling. $\{P^{(i)}\}$ are auxiliary predictions from decoder stages 1--3, with $\lambda_i = 0.4, 0.3, 0.2$ corresponding to stages 3, 2, 1 respectively.
The proposed DP-UNet is an improved architecture over CM-UNet, designed to enhance segmentation accuracy and optimize computational efficiency through structural innovations. It achieves these goals by replacing the original MSAA with the MSK module to eliminate redundant computations and by introducing the DVSS block in place of the single-path CSMamba block, thereby decoupling global context modeling from local detail refinement. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the network consists of three main components: a ResNet-18-based [6] encoder for multi-level feature extraction, MSK modules for multi-scale feature fusion, and a DVSS-based decoder for progressive upsampling and refinement.
